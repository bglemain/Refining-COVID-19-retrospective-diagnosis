# Estimating SARS-CoV-2 infection probabilities with serological data and a Bayesian mixture model

This repository contains the code associated with the study "Estimating SARS-CoV-2 infection probabilities with serological data and a Bayesian mixture model" (Glemain et al., submitted).

This repository contains three files :  
-- The reusable R code to estimate infection probaility after the first wave, given an ELISA ODR value (Euroimmun anti-S1 IgG) and a cumulative incidence estimate (a 95% CI)  
-- The Stan code used in the study to estimate the distribution of ELISA log-ODR in the infected  
-- The Stan code used in the study for the main model
